Function Declarations -
A function declaration or function definition starts with the function
keyword, which is followed by the name of the function.

Function Expressions -
Another option is to use a function expression.

One thing to be aware of when deciding between a function declaration
and a function expression is that function declarations are hoisted and
function expressions are not. In other words, you can invoke a function
before you write a function declaration. You cannot invoke a function
created by a function expression.
